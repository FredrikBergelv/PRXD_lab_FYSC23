\subsection{Crystal Lattice Structure}

To calculate the distance between planes the formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{d^2}=\frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}.
\end{equation}
If we use this formula for a simple cubic with $a=b=c=\SI{0.432}{\nano\m}$ for the plane(111) we get the separation to $d=\SI{0.249}{\nano\m}$. If we do the same for the plane (211) we obtain a separation of $d=\SI{0.176}{\nano\m}$ and for the plane (100) we get $d=\SI{0.432}{\nano\m}$. 



\subsection{Diffraction}

To evaluate diffraction patterns Bragg's law is mainly used, with is defined as
\begin{equation}
    n\lambda=2d\sin \theta,
    \label{eq:Bragg}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is an integer, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the incoming photon, $d$ is the spacing between the planes and $\theta$ is the scattering angle. Using this we see that if the incoming x-ray has a wavelength of \SI{0.07}{\nano\m} we can at minimum spacing which can be observed is \SI{0.35}{\angstrom}. In order to observe smaller spacings, a higher photon energy would have to be used. 

\subsection{Powder X-ray Diffraction}

Transmission, fluorescence, 

Xray diffraction, oscillating E field. When X ray hit the electrons the electrons start o vibrate in that frequency
- Constructive and destructive interference 

Bragg's law: $n\lambda=PD=2s=2d\sin\theta$

Crystal lattice: fcc, bcc


In powder diffraction we have all possible orientation sof the crystallites and some will be oriented in the right way for diffraction. Give rise to powder diffraction rings. 

Scherrer's formula
\begin{equation}
    t=\frac{k\lambda}{\beta\cos\theta}
\end{equation}

Structure factor: Se photos. For a simple cubic we see all peaks, for bcc and fcc we loose some peaks.
