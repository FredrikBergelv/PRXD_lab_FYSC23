\section{Method}
The energy of the x-rays are \SI{17.45}{\kilo\electronvolt}. 

The detector uses six semiconductors. 

Calibrations of hex.., this is good since we have a lot of diffraction rings.  

1. Put in all the data
2. mask out dead spots
3. Tell where the rings are 
4. The image is converted to an intensity plot (Note that the x-axis is in $2\theta$). 


Hot pixel, high peak with no width. The pixel can be burnt out.
